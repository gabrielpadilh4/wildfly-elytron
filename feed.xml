            <description>
                Mutual TLS with client certificates is essential for secure and encrypted communication between clients and servers in various applications and systems. It involves a handshake process during which both the client and the server must present their certificate to each other in order to establish a secure connection. This ensures...

            <description>
                The default algorithm used for the digest authentication mechanism is MD5. You can configure the WildFly server to also require or accept the SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 algorithms. This configuration can be specified in the mechanism-configuration attribute of both the http-authentication-factory and the sasl-authentication-factory: &lt;http-authentication-factory name="exampleHttpAuthFactory" security-domain="exampleSD" http-server-mechanism-factory="global"&gt; &lt;mechanism-configuration&gt; &lt;mechanism mechanism-name="DIGEST-SHA-256"&gt;...

            <description>
                Sometimes, you need to access additional information about an authenticated user. As an example, you may want to know when they logged in, or what information they have on file. Traditionally, this type of information needed to be stored using security realm attributes associated with an identity. Now in WildFly...
